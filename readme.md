<table>
	<tr><th>Abstract</th></tr>
	<tr><td><p>The <span class=product>Piqueme</span> DOM component is a just-in-time continuous feed of articles featuring collapsable/expandable UI cards.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

### Background

Visitors appreciate the compact beauty of UI cards. They provide so much more
than a simple hyperlink.

UI cards typically have some combination of these elements: image, headline
and/or lede paragraph. UI cards give visitors the gist of hyperlinked articles
without the effort â€” for visitors, there's no forward navigation to check out a
new page; and there's no back navigation to continue where they left off.

UI cards *keep visitors on the same page*, and keep them reading your content.

The <span>rwt-piqueme</span> goes two steps further than the classic UI
card: 1) it allows the visitor to read the entire article without ever leaving
the original document, and 2) it saves network bandwidth by fetching articles
only when needed.

The <span>rwt-piqueme</span> component has these features:

   * Articles are initially displayed in *UI card* format with splash image, caption,
      kicker, headline, subhead, byline, dateline and lede.
   * Visitors can choose to read the full article *in situ*, that is, without ever
      leaving the host page.
   * UI cards can be toggled between collapsed and expanded states, to show just the
      UI card, or the full article.
   * Articles are fetched just-in-time, when the visitor scrolls down to that part of
      the document.
   * A document that contains a large set of potential UI cards will only fetch
      what's needed, and only when it's needed.
   * Each component instance handles a single on-demand article.

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

The <span>rwt-piqueme</span> DOM component works in any browser that
supports modern W3C standards. It has no other prerequisites. Distribution and
installation are done with either NPM or via Github.

#### Download


<details>
	<summary>Download using NPM</summary>
	<p><b>OPTION 1:</b> Familiar with Node.js and the <code>package.json</code> file?<br />Great. Install the component with this command:</p>
	<pre lang=bash>
npm install rwt-piqueme<br />	</pre>
	<p><b>OPTION 2:</b> No prior experience using NPM?<br />Just follow these general steps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Install <a href='https://nodejs.org'>Node.js/NPM</a> on your development computer.</li>
		<li>Create a <code>package.json</code> file in the root of your web project using the command:</li>
		<pre lang=bash>
npm init<br />		</pre>
		<li>Download and install the DOM component using the command:</li>
		<pre lang=bash>
npm install rwt-piqueme<br />		</pre>
	</ul>
	<p style='font-size:0.9em'>Important note: This DOM component uses Node.js and NPM and <code>package.json</code> as a convenient <i>distribution and installation</i> mechanism. The DOM component itself does not need them.</p>
</details>


<details>
	<summary>Download using Github</summary>
	<p>If you prefer using Github directly, simply follow these steps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a <code>node_modules</code> directory in the root of your web project.</li>
		<li>Clone the <span class=product>rwt-piqueme</span> DOM component into it using the command:</li>
		<pre lang=bash>
git clone https://github.com/readwritetools/rwt-piqueme.git<br />		</pre>
	</ul>
</details>

### Using the component

After installation, you should add two things to your HTML page to make use of
it:

   1. Add a `script` tag to load the component's `rwt-piqueme.js` file:
```html
<script src='/node_modules/rwt-piqueme/rwt-piqueme.js' type=module></script>             
```

   2. Add articles to the page one by one, identifying their location with the
      component's `sourceref` attribute:
```html
<rwt-piqueme sourceref='/2021/Jan/article01.html'></rwt-piqueme>

<rwt-piqueme sourceref='/2021/Feb/article02.html'></rwt-piqueme>

<rwt-piqueme sourceref='/2021/Mar/article03.html'></rwt-piqueme>

<rwt-piqueme sourceref='/2021/Apr/article04.html'></rwt-piqueme>
```


### Article meta data

The UI card properties that the visitor sees are extracted in real-time from
each article. They are pulled from `<meta>` tags placed in each article's `<head>`.
You should configure your web server to add the following meta tags:


<dl>
	<dt><code>picueme:photo</code></dt>
	<dd>The URL to a picture to splash across the top of the UI card.</dd>
	<dt><code>piqueme:caption</code></dt>
	<dd>A one line description of the splash picture.</dd>
	<dt><code>piqueme:kicker</code></dt>
	<dd>A word or short phrase placed above the headline.</dd>
	<dt><code>piqueme:headline</code></dt>
	<dd>The article's title.</dd>
	<dt><code>piqueme:subhead</code></dt>
	<dd>The article's subtitle.</dd>
	<dt><code>piqueme:byline</code></dt>
	<dd>The author of the article.</dd>
	<dt><code>piqueme:dateline</code></dt>
	<dd>The date the article was published.</dd>
	<dt><code>piqueme:lede</code></dt>
	<dd>The first paragraph of the article.</dd>
	<dt><code>piqueme:textblock</code></dt>
	<dd>An HTML DOM selector referencing the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> that contains the text of the article.</dd>
</dl>

All `<meta>` tags are optional. Configure only the ones that you want displayed in
the UI card.

Note that all URL's are subject to the browser's same-origin security policy. If
articles or images are coming from a different server, you must ask that
server's administrator to configure CORS permissions for your origin server.

### UI card layout and styling

The HTML layout for the UI card is configured in the component's `rwt-piqueme.blue`
file. Only advanced applications will need to change this.

The default CSS styling uses a dark mode theme. It is configured in the `rwt-piqueme.css`
file. You can replace the contents of this file with CSS that matches your
website's typeface and color theme.

### Life-cycle events

The component issues life-cycle events. These can be used in advanced
applications to trigger other actions.


<dl>
	<dt><code>component-loaded</code></dt>
	<dd>Sent when the component is fully loaded and ready to be used.</dd>
	<dt><code>fetch-complete</code></dt>
	<dd>Sent when an article has been fetched over the network. The event's <code>detail</code> property will contain two values: <code>remoteURL</code> and <code>fetchStatus</code>.</dd>
</dl>
