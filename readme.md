	<tr><td><p>The <span class=product>Piqueme</span> DOM component is a just-in-time continuous feed of articles with collapse/expand control.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

### Background

Visitors appreciate the compact beauty of UI cards. They provide so much more
than a simple hyperlink.

UI cards typically have some combination of these elements: splash image,
caption, kicker, headline, subhead, and/or lede paragraph.

UI cards give visitors the gist of hyperlinked articles without the effort â€” for
visitors, there's no forward navigation to a new page; and there's no back
navigation to continue where they left off.

UI cards *keep visitors on the same page*, and keep them reading your content.

The <span>rwt-piqueme</span> goes two steps further. It allows the
visitor to read the entire article without ever leaving the original document.
And it saves network bandwidth by fetching articles only when needed.

The Piqueme component has these features:

   * Articles are initially displayed in *UI card* format with splash image, caption,
      kicker, headline, subhead and lede.
   * Visitors can choose to read the full article *in situ*.
   * UI cards can be toggled between collapsed and expanded states.
   * Articles are fetched just-in-time, when the visitor scrolls that part of the
      document into view.
   * A document that contains a large set of potential UI cards will fetch only
      what's needed, and when needed.
   * Each component instance handles a single on-demand article.

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

The <span>rwt-piqueme</span> DOM component works in any browser that
supports modern W3C standards.

The UI card layout template can be modified using either plain HTML or <span>
BLUE</span><span>PHRASE</span> notation (which can be compiled into HTML using the
free <a href='https://hub.readwritetools.com/desktop/rwview.blue'>Read Write View</a>
desktop app). It has no other prerequisites. Distribution and installation are
done with either NPM or via Github.

#### Download


<details>
	<summary>Download using NPM</summary>
	<p>If you are familiar with Node.js and the <code>package.json</code> file, you'll be comfortable installing the component just using this command:</p>
	<pre lang=bash>
npm install rwt-piqueme<br />	</pre>
	<p>If you are a front-end Web developer with no prior experience with NPM, follow these general steps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Install <a href='https://nodejs.org'>Node.js/NPM</a> on your development computer.</li>
		<li>Create a <code>package.json</code> file in the root of your web project using the command:</li>
		<pre lang=bash>
npm init<br />		</pre>
		<li>Download and install the DOM component using the command:</li>
		<pre lang=bash>
npm install rwt-piqueme<br />		</pre>
	</ul>
	<p style='font-size:0.9em'>Important note: This DOM component uses Node.js and NPM and <code>package.json</code> as a convenient <i>distribution and installation</i> mechanism. The DOM component itself does not need them.</p>
</details>


<details>
	<summary>Download using Github</summary>
	<p>If you are more comfortable using Github for installation, follow these steps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a directory <code>node_modules</code> in the root of your web project.</li>
		<li>Clone the <span class=product>rwt-piqueme</span> DOM component into it using the command:</li>
		<pre lang=bash>
git clone https://github.com/readwritetools/rwt-piqueme.git<br />		</pre>
	</ul>
</details>

### Using the component

After installation, you need to add two things to your HTML page to make use of
it:

   1. Add a `script` tag to load the component's `rwt-piqueme.js` file:
```html
<script src='/node_modules/rwt-piqueme/rwt-piqueme.js' type=module></script>             
```

   2. Add articles to the page one by one, identifying their location with the
      component's `sourceref` attribute:
```html
<rwt-piqueme sourceref='https://example.com/article01.html'></rwt-piqueme>
<rwt-piqueme sourceref='https://example.com/article02.html'></rwt-piqueme>
<rwt-piqueme sourceref='https://example.com/article03.html'></rwt-piqueme>
<rwt-piqueme sourceref='https://example.com/article04.html'></rwt-piqueme>
```


### Life-cycle events

The component issues life-cycle events. These can be used in advanced
applications to trigger other actions.


<dl>
	<dt><code>component-loaded</code></dt>
	<dd>Sent when the component is fully loaded and ready to be used.</dd>
	<dt><code>fetch-complete</code></dt>
	<dd>Sent when an article has been fetched over the network. The event's <code>detail</code> property will contain two values: <code>remoteURL</code> and <code>fetchStatus</code>.</dd>
</dl>
